# Lingua Ping 🌐🔔

This Mastodon bot monitors posts on our server. It identifies non-English posts and sends direct messages to the post author with a friendly reminder to provide translations for their posts.

## Features

- Connects to the Mastodon API using a specified token.
- Fetches posts from the home timeline -- so the bot has to be following a user for them to be eligible for a ping
- Detects the language of each post (uses the [franc](https://github.com/wooorm/franc) library with a threshold of the top 20* most spoken languages globally)
- Checks whether we have already messaged the user about this specific post
- Sends a direct message to the user about their non-English post

\* _franc supports many more languages but my shitposts kept getting classified as Scots so..._
